\1{\right{Security Groups}}
fundamental of network security, control how traffic is allowed into or out of EC2 machines, act as virtual firewall 

security group:
\{
  \> can be attached to multiple instances
  \> locked down to a region
  \> lives ``outside'' the EC2 - if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won't see it
  \> By default, all inbound traffic is {\color{red} blocked} and all outbound traffic is {\color{green} authorized}
  \> security groups can reference other security groups, IPs, CIDR blocks but not DNS names
